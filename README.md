# Secure Data Hiding in Images using Steganography (Python)

## Introduction
In this project I have demonstrated a method to securely hide data in images using steganography. It allows users to encrypt and decrypt messages within images using a passcode.

## Features
- **Message Encryption**: Hide secret messages within images.
- **Passcode Protection**: Secure hidden messages with a passcode.
- **Easy Decryption**: Retrieve messages with the correct passcode.
- **Minimal Dependencies**: Requires only OpenCV for image processing.

## Requirements
To run this project, install the following:

- Python 3.0 or higher version
- OpenCV (for image processing)

Install OpenCV using:
```bash
pip install opencv-python
pip install cv2
```

## How to use
1. Place the image file in the project directory.
2. Run the script and enter the secret message and passcode.
3. The encrypted image will be saved.
4. Use the decryption option to retrieve the hidden message with the correct passcode.
